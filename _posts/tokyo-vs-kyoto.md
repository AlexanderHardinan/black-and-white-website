Japan’s dining scene is a tale of **two cities**.  
On one hand, **Tokyo** — a sprawling metropolis where chefs chase innovation and global influence.  
On the other, **Kyoto** — the ancient capital, preserving centuries-old culinary traditions with unparalleled refinement.

## Tokyo: Innovation at Every Turn
Tokyo boasts more Michelin-starred restaurants than any city in the world. Its chefs experiment boldly — blending tradition with global flavors.

## Kyoto: Guardians of Tradition
Kyoto remains the spiritual home of **Kaiseki** — refined multi-course dining defined by seasonality and restraint.

## Conclusion
Two philosophies, one identity. In 2025, both cities stand unmatched as global culinary capitals.
